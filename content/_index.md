    content: My journey in software development began in late 2014, when I taught
      myself Java to join my high school's UIL Computer Science team. As an
      upperclassman, I taught new members useful OO programming practices and
      led my team in group competitions. In 2016, I self-taught C# and used the
      Unity 3D game engine to practice systematic architecture and design.
      Having enrolled at Texas Tech in 2018, I've since become familiar with C
      and C++. My current projects are exercises in systematic architecture,
      using object-oriented paradigms to design and control relations between
      objects. Check out my GitHub to see my published projects!
