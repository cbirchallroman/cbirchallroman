      My journey in software development began in late 2014, when I taught
      myself Java to join my high school's UIL Computer Science team. I took on
      a leadership role there, teaching new members and leading my team in group
      competitions by delegating tasks and managing time. In 2016, I self-taught
      C# and used the Unity game engine to practice architecture and systematic
      design. Having enrolled at Texas Tech in 2018, I've since become familiar
      with C and C++. My personal projects since 2016 have been exercises in
      architectural design.
