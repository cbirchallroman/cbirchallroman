      My journey in software development began in late 2014, when I taught
      myself Java to join my high school's UIL Computer Science team where I
      participated in group problem-solving competitions. I took on a leadership
      role there, teaching new members and leading my team in group competitions
      by delegating tasks and managing time. In 2016, I self-taught C# for
      independent study and used the Unity game engine to develop my interest in
      architecture and systematic design. Having enrolled at Texas Tech in 2018,
      I've since become familiar with C and C++ through my coursework. My
      personal projects since 2016 have been exercises in architectural design.
