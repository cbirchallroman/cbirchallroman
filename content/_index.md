      I'm an honors student at Texas Tech University pursuing dual degrees in
      computer science (B.S.) and classical culture (B.A.). I'm interested in
      systems design and backend development.

      My journey in software development began in late 2014, when I taught
      myself Java to join my high school's UIL Computer Science team. As an
      upperclassman, I taught new members useful OO programming practices and
      led my team in group competitions. In 2016, I self-taught C# and used the
      Unity 3D game engine to practice systematic architecture and design.
      Having enrolled at Texas Tech in 2018, I've since become familiar with C
      and C++. My current projects are exercises in systematic architecture,
      using object-oriented paradigms to design and control relations between
      objects.
