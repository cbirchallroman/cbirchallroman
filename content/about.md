**Calvin Birchall-Roman** is a sophomore student at Texas Tech University, studying computer science (B.S.) and classical culture (B.A.). He is interested in structural programming, especially in databases and simulation programs. His secret hobby is amateur game development—he has made the same game two or three times to perfect its architecture and learn from each previous version’s faults.

Calvin believes that programming solutions should be elegant and that software architecture should be treated as an art. It is not enough to write a program that works: the developer's task is to design a cohesive system which can be effortlessly understood and added onto without negotiating with faulty structural practices. Calvin's interest in structuralism from the humanities extends to his treatment of object relations in software development. He is interested in using levels of abstraction to interface between objects, controlling the flow of data and from what they are concealed.

Calvin also researches for the classics department as an Honors Undergraduate Research Scholar. He is investigating Greco-Roman literature and Lacanian psychoanalysis to develop an undergraduate honors thesis for his senior year. His current project analyzes the myth of Pandora according to *Works and Days*, where he uncovers the meaning of Hope trapped in Pandora's jar.

Calvin’s hobbies outside of recreational programming include reading social theory, playing cozy video games, and weight training. His favorite show is *Letterkenny*, and his favorite book for fun is *Insignia*.
